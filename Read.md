SCENARIO
Build a single page portfolio website with a contact form section. The final product will need to meet the following requirements:
 
Requirements
•	Include an index.html file written in HTML5 with semantic tags where possible, i.e. <nav>, <sidebar>, <article> etc. It needs to be valid to W3C standards.
•	Organise your files into appropriate directories such as images, CSS, etc.
•	Include a styles.scss file which has been compiled and minified into style.css via a SASS pre-processor. The file includes the required partials, such as _variables.scss and _mixins.scss.
•	The code must make effective use of nesting, mixins and variables to reduce code duplication.
•	Incorporate the latest version of Bootstrap framework. It is required to use Bootstrap grid for layout and media mixins to create responsive breakpoints for all major screen sizes.
•	The web page needs to have smooth animation between page anchor points.
•	The design incorporates code for an animated fade-in overlay controlled by CSS animation and triggered by javascript.
•	All text in the document, such as employment history and education should be your original work. You will also need to use public domain images you have sourced.
•	Finally, ensure all code is tidy, well-commented, and correctly nested and indented.
