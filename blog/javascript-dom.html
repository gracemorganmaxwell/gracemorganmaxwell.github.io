          <h3>
            <em
              >Basically HTML, CSS and Javascript are the three fundamentals</em
            >
            that allow interactive websites found all over the world wide web to
            exist, to be created and changed on-going. For context I am running
            through what is HTML, CSS and <em>JavaScript.</em>
          </h3>
          <h3>
            HTML, stands for hypertext markup language and it is the building
            block for the internet.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Webpages from websites based all over the world wide web (www) use
            HTML syntax to create structure for their content. A webpages actual
            content would likely contain text and images, maybe video or audio
            files, it would likely link to other webpages from the same website
            or perhaps an external site or two. HTML syntax gives us the ability
            to build a framework for a webpage and structure our sites content
            in a way which is user friendly for the target audience of the
            webpage or project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a house, 3 bedrooms home with a family bathroom and two
            stories. That is the HTML of the building. But at this stage it's a
            blueprint on the desk of a project manager, a plan for a structure
            with content inbetween.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <em>
              HTML is enhanced and modified by other technologies, one of them
              is <b>CSS, which stands for cascading styles sheets.</b>
            </em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            CSS is used to control the aesthetic, the formatting and layout of
            webpages. CSS describes how the HTML elements, the framework and the
            content (text, images etc) should be presented on the webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward 6 months to now, that house blueprint has come to life
            and the house is built. Made of red bricks with a solid wood
            front-door, which can be seen from the street. Inside each room of
            the family home there is a coorindiating collection of
            attributes(rules for how it should look). The attributes modify the
            HTML framework and the content it contains (ie. carpetted floors,
            wooden stairs and painted walls, drapes framming the windows). As a
            consequence of the hardwork done by HTML + CSS the user is left
            feeling like they are at home.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <em>
              The other technology that commonly modifies HTML is
              <b>JS or Javascript</b>
            </em>
            in fact 97% of websites on the web use JavaScript according to
            Wikipedia.
          </h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript, is an object orientated programming language, unlike the
            HTML and CSS which although important, aren't powerful. JS
            determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page and
            brings life to a page, from static to dynamic and responsive. JS
            determines what happens when users click, hover or type within
            certain elements, makes them interactive. This is kind of like the
            functionality of the building.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to the house, you know the layout, structure and what it looks
            like, the aesthetic. But what can you do within the house? You can
            eat… sleep… open doors... turn the tap on/off... make meals… plug
            the tv in and watch Netflix... anything that you do at home, really!
            That is the JavaScript of the building. It brings the capability and
            function of the home alive for the user.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <em> What is <b>Control Flow?</b> </em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            By default JS code is executed from top to bottom, line by line
            however we can change this Control Flow. This allows our program to
            make decisions about what code is executed and when. Control flow is
            all about the order in which our code is run. We are able to control
            the flow of our code and either execut or loop over certain sections
            of code depending if a given condition is true or false. This gives
            our program the ability to change based on conditions and
            intelligently automate repeative tasks.
          </p>
          <h3>Consider the diagram below:</h3>
          <img src="/images/controlFlowEx.png" alt="control flow example diagram" class="img_frame"/>
          <p>
            Is this diagram we show how depending on the input or choice made by
            a user will then result in different possible outcomes for the user.
            In this case will they end out getting takeout or not? By using
            conditional statements in JS that can achieve a different outcome
            for the user.
          </p>
          <h3>Conditional Statements:</h3>
          <p>
            Conditional statements are basically checks to see if a certain
            consition is either truw or false. If the consition is true then run
            code A, if it's false then run code B.
          </p>
          <h3>What are Loops?</h3>
          <p>
            Loops, are a conditional statement that allow us to perform
            repetitive tasks with less code. For example using loops we can
            iterate over an array and perform some sort of action on each piece
            of data in the array, or we can use a loop to compile a list of all
            the items.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/jsForLoopFlowchart.png"
            alt="JavaScript for loop flowchart" class="img_frame"
          />
          <p>
            There are a variety of Loop statement, such as 'for' loop,
            'do/while' loop, 'for..in' loop and finally 'for..of' loop.
          </p>
          <h3><em>What is the DOM? The DOM stands for the Document Object Model.</h3>
          <p>
            The DOM lives mostly behind the scenes and is made up of a tree of objects 
            called “nodes”, as you can see here:
          </p>
          <img src="/images/DOM.png" alt="diagram of the DOM" class="img_frame">
          <p></p>
          <p>
            How to interact with the DOM.. Usually in your browser directly via
            the Dev Tools for Chrome for example or via code being hosted live
            to a set URL on a server, by or using the Live Share option in an
            IDE like Visual Studio.
