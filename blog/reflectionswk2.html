          <h4># Your Blog</h4>

          <h4>
            Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
          </h4>

          <p>
            I went about completeing the setup of my Blog as per Sprint 2 - Tech
            directrions setout in the Dev Acaemdy Handbook. By adding a
            directory named "Blog" to local workspace for the Blog project on my
            Mac. Inside this directory as instructed I added a template .html
            document. Called 'te-houtaewa-template.html.' Then I added a css
            file called 'main.css' into a directory called 'styles', following
            this I linked the css to the index.html file.
          </p>

          />

          <h4>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h4>

          <p>
            The TimeBoxes work for me when I properly implement them and don't
            allow myself to waste too much time on silly things like getting a
            perfect navbar, or colour scheme or the like. The last exercise I
            was fine and flew through. It's when I go rouge from the handbook,
            because I feel like I know what I need to do and end up on a side
            tangent, time just runs away from me. I need to keep my eyes on the
            ball or the handbook I should say, stay focused, use the Toggl and
            Pomodoro and my task checklist (for the day) along side my schedule
            to stay on point.
          </p>

          <h4>Learn HTML and CSS</h4>

          <h4>
            What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
          </h4>

          <p>
            My ego, while coding the blog project I wanted it to sport a lot of
            elements commonly found on most sites. I was really OCD and set the
            bar too high. I was silly enough to try and restart three times.
            Didn't ask for help. Who knew a navbar with a non traditional
            configuration inluding a dropdown annd some other features would be
            so hard. Any-who, I reacessed my goals for the projects and scaled
            back my plans. Because I went over time wise and felt like I wasn'ty
            moving forwards. I changed how I was thinking about it as a whole.
            What is the task I have been given? Go back to the Dev Academy
            Handbook and following the instructions given. I assured myself I
            can always come back and tinker with the project later when I have
            more time and actually what I have made thus far isn't bad. The
            obstacle I tackled with the most was myself, my OCD, if I can
            control this task and make it perfect then I'm safe and everything
            will be okay. That relates to me having PTSD and my inner child
            feeling a lack of safety or control in life generally and so I try
            to find that feeling in what I do day to day. Thing is, I know
            perfect isn't achieveable for so many reasons and it's all actually
            about the jounery, learning and growing. Not about creating the
            perfect static blog site from CSS, HTML and a little JS. I
            challenged myself to implement a JS element into this project thus
            far and actually it worked. It's in the header via the .sticky class
            and causes a sticky navigation bar effect where the navbar follows
            you down the page as you scroll and changes in appearance through
            that transition.
          </p>

          <h4>What are of you proud of from this challenge?</h4>

          <p>
            The project as a whole and the JS element I have added in. Defiantly
            not my timing.
          </p>

          <h4>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h4>

          <h4>
            Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You
            could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience.
            The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.
          </h4>

          <p>
            Mr. HTML is a structured man, he sets our frameworks in this
            community that contain raw content in their origional form. He
            doesn't worry about the look of things, he focuses on functionality
            and order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ms. CSS is a creative lass, she takes the work done by Mr. HTML and
            smartens it up. Colour, spacing, animations effects and more. She is
            a graphic designer of a soul and brings Mr. HTMls work to life. From
            drab and black and white to colour, forms and interactivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some think HTML and CSS aren't real programming languages, and
            compared to JaveScript or C#, they aren't. But without them web
            development wouldn't be the same.
          </p>

          <h4>Any moments of surprise or joy?</h4>

          <p>Yes, when I got the JS working :)</p>

          <h4>
            If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would
            be? Why?
          </h4>

          <p>
            HTML would be a cow, black and white, what you see is what you get.
            Drab, serves a function. Important for the function of society as we
            know it.
          </p>

          <p>
            CSS, would be a unicorn with rainbow farts. Because of it's endless
            possibility to bring the drab alive.
          </p>

          <h4>Final Reflections - Sprint Two</h4>

          <h4>
            In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the
            following questions:
          </h4>

          <h4>
            How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from
            this sprint?
          </h4>

          <p>Yeah, pretty confident.</p>

          <h4>Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?</h4>

          <p>
            The coding, but at the sametime not the coding, well not the more
            challenging parts I tried anyway. So the easier coding parts, self
            reflection and also the self development parts.
          </p>

          <h4>Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?</h4>

          <p>
            The part where I tried to challenge myself to make the best ever
            site sporting all the bells and whistles. And how this made me awful
            with time.
          </p>

          <h4>
            How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it
            say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
          </h4>
          <p>
            It got me down when what I wanted to achieve was here and what I was
            actually achieveing was over there, they had a huge gap. But
            reshaped my thinking, course corrected and got back on track. Back
            to the handbook and focus on the task at hand, break it into doable
            chunks. And proceed.
          </p>

          <h4>
            If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a
            website?" what would you say?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Wix, just kidding. Checkout freecodecamp.com if you'd like to do it
            for real yourself. Get setup with visual studio. Go through the HTML
            and CSS basics in FreeCodeCamp and then watch a tutorial or two on
            YouTube 'How to make a css + html website" or something similiar.
            Wham, bam, presto! That's how you can teach yourself to make a
            website.
          </p>
