    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>Sprint 2</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I want to be able to solve complex code based problems and do full stack
      projects myself. I would like to go down one of two paths that benefits
      from the study I’m doing today. One is a programmer (any type, not sure
      whether front or back end is more enjoyable), the second is a Business
      Analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to help others, problem solve, work in a team, have on-going
      development and is an end outcome for work put in. I feel either as a
      coder or as a business analyst, I could have a role which incorporates all
      these aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal beyond that which I’ve stated for dream role is to find a
      workplace which has a great culture, which believes in flexible working
      hours, developing their staff and being family orientated. They will use
      sustainable practices, be community minded and only take on projects or
      clients that are adding value to the world, no Donald Trumps thanks.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
      learning:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I find that time, time tracking, information tangents or going down rabbit
      holes are something I need to be careful with, they can end-up being huge
      time sinks, it’s defiantly an area I’m trying to improve in currently. On
      one side you can say I’m good at research, I have an analytical mind and
      inquisitive mind. Which is great for problem solving. One the limitations
      side, it depends on the context and balance is important. Staying on task
      is important and going off topic is going to do me no favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all connected to some OCD I have around perfectionism, with doing
      study or work and the product of it needing to be amazing. I love hearing
      praise, who doesn’t. Even though I’m fully aware perfection is not a
      status one can actually achieve. The OCD is linked back to me liking to be
      in control of my environment and anything I do within it, as part of my
      trauma based PTSD.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s silly, I know we are learning and my first project is fine looking
      like something out of the 90’s. But I’d much rather it look amazing and
      feel as though the 90’s option isn’t good enough for the public eye, that
      I’ve failed. But deep down, I am aware for now it’s good, and actually
      with time and practice I’ll be able to create projects that do look
      amazing. Having an eye for detail, caring about the quality of my work is
      a strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to help others and I am a people pleaser, saying no to others can
      take my focus away from study mentally and, or physically. Staying present
      in the moment with my tasks is something I’m working on also, my Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapist taught me a mental strategy where you “reset,
      refocus and just be present.” It’s a mindfulness-type technique, but it
      takes a while to 100% retrain your brain my therapist said, so takes a lot
      of practice. Each day.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More self-awareness around time management and self-management.</li>
      <li>
        Feeling more confident saying ‘no’ and putting my needs for study first.
      </li>
      <li>Feeling more confident showing work of mine which isn’t perfect.</li>
      <li>
        Better stress management when I find a task hard and being okay asking
        for help, if Googling isn’t helping.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I commit to self-manage myself through keeping to a strict routine which I
      believe incorporates tools and elements which will enable me to an
      effective individual or member of a team.
    </p>
    <p>
      These include: good sleep hygiene, lots of water, yoga, authentic
      conversations, self-reflection and asking for help. Not keeping my mobile
      on my desk – but on the opposite side of the room, leave social media and
      social events for the weekend. Not drink more than two coffees a day and
      not after 5pm, aka not too much caffeine.

    <h3>
      What will I do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’ll do belly breathing, take stock of the situation and options, be
      honest with myself through self-reflection, be authentic with those around
      me or whom I’m collaborating with.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
    </h3>
    <p>
      First I’ll try Google, using resources like stack overflow, YouTube and
      generally the internet. I will seek help through Slack with team members
      or facilitators if I’ve been stuck for more than 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
    <p>
      In our weekly 1:1, creative critic and suggestions for moving forward.
    </p>
    <h3>Scheduling information:</h3>
    <p>
