          <h3><em>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</em></h3>
          <p>
            I want to be able to solve complex code based problems and do full
            stack projects myself. I would like to go down one of two paths that
            benefits from the study I’m doing today. One is a programmer (any
            type, not sure whether front or back end is more enjoyable), the
            second is a Business Analyst.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to help others, problem solve, work in a team, have on-going
            development and is an end outcome for work put in. I feel either as
            a coder or as a business analyst, I could have a role which
            incorporates all these aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal beyond that which I’ve stated for dream role is to find a
            workplace which has a great culture, which believes in flexible
            working hours, developing their staff and being family orientated.
            They will use sustainable practices, be community minded and only
            take on projects or clients that are adding value to the world, no

            A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
            learning:
          </h3>
          <p>
            I find that time, time tracking, information tangents or going down
            rabbit holes are something I need to be careful with, they can
            end-up being huge time sinks, it’s defiantly an area I’m trying to
            improve in currently. On one side you can say I’m good at research,
            I have an analytical mind and inquisitive mind. Which is great for
            problem solving. One the limitations side, it depends on the context
            and balance is important. Staying on task is important and going off
            topic is going to do me no favours.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is all connected to some OCD I have around perfectionism, with
            doing study or work and the product of it needing to be amazing. I
            love hearing praise, who doesn’t. Even though I’m fully aware
            perfection is not a status one can actually achieve. The OCD is
            linked back to me liking to be in control of my environment and
            anything I do within it, as part of my trauma based PTSD.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s silly, I know we are learning and my first project is fine
            looking like something out of the 90’s. But I’d much rather it look
            amazing and feel as though the 90’s option isn’t good enough for the
            public eye, that I’ve failed. But deep down, I am aware for now it’s
            good, and actually with time and practice I’ll be able to create
            projects that do look amazing. Having an eye for detail, caring
            about the quality of my work is a strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to help others and I am a people pleaser, saying no to others
            can take my focus away from study mentally and, or physically.
            Staying present in the moment with my tasks is something I’m working
            on also, my Cognitive Behavioural Therapist taught me a mental
            strategy where you “reset, refocus and just be present.” It’s a
            mindfulness-type technique, but it takes a while to 100% retrain
            your brain my therapist said, so takes a lot of practice. Each day.

            <li>
              More self-awareness around time management and self-management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Feeling more confident saying ‘no’ and putting my needs for study
              first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Feeling more confident showing work of mine which isn’t perfect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Better stress management when I find a task hard and being okay
              asking for help, if Googling isn’t helping.

          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:
          </h3>
          <p>
            I commit to self-manage myself through keeping to a strict routine
            which I believe incorporates tools and elements which will enable me
            to an effective individual or member of a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            These include: good sleep hygiene, lots of water, yoga, authentic
            conversations, self-reflection and asking for help. Not keeping my
            mobile on my desk – but on the opposite side of the room, leave
            social media and social events for the weekend. Not drink more than
            two coffees a day and not after 5pm, aka not too much caffeine.

            and generally the internet. I will seek help through Slack with team
            members or facilitators if I’ve been stuck for more than 30 minutes.
