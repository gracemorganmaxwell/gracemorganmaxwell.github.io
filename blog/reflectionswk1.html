    <h2 class="blogSubTitle">Sprint 1, April 2022</h2>
    <h3>Command Line Primer</h3>
    <h4>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h4>
    <p>
      The command line is like interfacing directly with the computer in a way it understands, with direct commands and requests. 
      Someone once told me computers are stupid, which isn't untrue. They have many capabilities, but the lack of consciousness, intelligence, and free thought mean they rely on our creators for direction. 
      They are created to be a tool to make the lives of humans easier, like other machines. 
      Like using a fancy toaster with multiple settings, the user must interface with the device, giving requests and altering settings for the desired outcome. 
      I like my toast crunchy but not burnt, and sometimes we get Vogels (small seedy bread) or Ploughmens (bulker doughier bread). 
      To achieve the desired outcome, the user needs to use the interface of the toaster (buttons and a dial on the device's exterior) to achieve my desired result of crunchy but not overcooked toast. 
      The difference between a toaster and a computer is that a toaster exists for one type of purpose, whereas a computer exists for countless. In the command line, I can't see buttons and dials. 
      But in combination with Google searching and some knowledge I already possess, I aim to use the command line to achieve my desired outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up, I always found it hard to say 'no' to others, and I always
      wanted to keep everyone around me happy. I'm working on it, of course. But
      I have PTSD, and a part of that is I believe I've been a people pleaser
      most of my life, something to do with wanting to belong to a group,
      family, organisation or team. Whatever the flavour of the month is. These
      experiences compounded over the years have shaped me regarding my
      character and my conduct with others in all walks of life. So now I try to
      say 'can I sleep on that' or a straight-up 'no' if I have enough spinning
      plates I'm trying to balance at the time.
    </p>
    <h4>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h4>
    <p>During Sprint 1 in some cases I was able to stick to the prescribecd timebox, yes. 
      In others I was not. What happened? What would I do differently next time? Good question. 
      Count to five. One, two, three, four, five and start. Not listen to my subconcious and just start. 
      Despite what we know why do we do the things that hurt ourselves, things that keep us further from our desired outcomes, or I should say our goals. 
      On Feb 21st my stomach under went surgery which left me a stomach pouch about 5% of the size of what it use to be, guess what my brain still isn't the wiser. That's why I don't feel hunger or full in the traditional sense. 
      Apparently it takes usually until 9 months post surgery till the brain is able to understand what's happened. Tricking our brains is sometimes the best way to achieve the outcome we want. 
      So next time, I'll count to five and just start. I remember reading that getting started is the hardest step and once started on a task usually individuals will continue instead of abandoning the task.</p>

  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrZAGVq25zw">Mel Robbins</a> talks about it here in this video.
    </p>
    <h4>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.</h4>
    <ul>
     <li> 'cd' command allows you to change directory, 'cd ..' allows you to navigate up a level or directory in the heiarchy of the computers filing management system.For example, if you are in the users profile directory you will have the tilde (~) present and if you type into the commandline cd desktop the commandline will take you to the desktop directory.</li>
  <li>'mkdir' command allows you to make a directory, or make another folder.For example if you want to make a directory for the projects folder you can write 'mkdir projects', and whatever directory you are In will make a directory inside that called reflections.</li>
<li>'mv' command allows you to rename your directory, or move as it is called to another location in the file managemnent system of your PC.</li>
<li>'ls' command is used to list all the files (including information, like file type) and directories(folders) within the current file system; which the commandline is accessing.</li>
<li>'pwd' command stands for "print working directory". You type in that command into the commandline and it will give you the exact file path for the file or (directory) folder you are currently accessing.</li>
<li>'touch' command is used to create a new file, it's best to have the commandline situated in the directory you wish for the file to be located.</li></ul>
    <h4>Did you learn anything unexpected?</h4>
    <p>I have previously encountered this content on commandline, so it was more of a good refresher on the commandline standard comands and workings.</p>
  <h4>Version Control with Git</h4>
  <h4>What's the difference between git and GitHub?</h4>
  <p>Git is localised to your PC and GitHub is cloud based where it can be accessed my multiple users or devices. I can only access Git on my Mac desktop, whereas I can access my GitHub content from my smartphone and laptop also on different wireless internet connections, keep in mind the internet is a giant network. But your local PC is isolated from the network in the sense that Git only saves content on your physical device. It's not until you share data from Git to GitHub via pushing commits in the terminal or by manually uploading them, that they are then widely acessible amongst different devices or by others user ie. your team mates on a group project.
</p>
<h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
</h4>
  <p>My grand mother had the most amazing chocolate chip cookie recipe, she had it written on a bit of paper, kept in a small box on the shelf in the kitchen. It wasn't until my mother took a photo, typed it out in word, printed and laminated copies to share amongst our whole family that it was widely accessible. 
    From there the digital copy got tweaked over the years, improved, my mother said. Once we had a digital copy of Grans receipe, it was easy to share, tweak and keep it safe. 
    Git is the origional local version or the stained bit of paper, with the recipe hand written on it living in the box on the shelf. GitHub is the digital version my mum created for the whole family to enjoy.</p>

  <h4>Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</h4>
 <p>Yes, I kept to the timebox. Although when going to the toliet or when the dogs start barking at a neighbourhood noise, it's easy to forget to push pause.</p>
 <h4>Install and Explore Git</h4>
 <h4>What is a Git workflow?</h4>
 <p>GitHub workflow or flow as it is sometimes called, is a branch based workflow. 
   GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
   You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production. A GitHub workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs.</p>
<p>Another way to describe a GitHub workflow is that can integrate the important updates of a collection of all the versions of the project along with some special information - Show what order the changes occurred; A description of each change; who was responsible for each change and this can all be viewed.</p>
<h4>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h4>  
<p>When confused or blocked I explore the issue, try Googling or following any helpful hints the computer might try and offer to me. This week I made the mistake of not asking for helping when I had difficulties and so issues ended out taking up a lot of time. It's hard to ask for help. I don't know what I'm afraid of, being seen as week I guess.</p>
<h4>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h4>
<p>Yes, create a more specfic plan for myself and that's my plan this Sunday actually in time for week 3, is to create a more concrete plan for my learning moving forward once Sprint 2 is complete.</p>
<h4>Track and Commit
</h4>
<h4>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h4>
<p>Stage and commit are levels as apart of the Git and GitHub process. Git and GitHub are a means of allowing people to save work and share it. Stage is level 1, it is like when you write your thoughts on to a piece of paper. 
  That information is captured for you. Commit is level 2. It's when you take the piece of paper containing your captured thoughts and type it into Word and save a digital copy. From here you can create changes and always have thr origional to refer back to.
</p>
<p>A better explanantion or analogy I found online written by Fai Songprasit from a previous cohort.</p>

<p>"Its like doing a jigsaw puzzle with lots of people, most people find the corners and frame pieces first (working stage) then a picture is taken to keep a record of where you are just in case you stop for lunch (staged) then you come back to it and each work on a small section at a time until you are happy that this is all you can do for now, 
  take another picture just in case you have to stop for the day (staged again) then if you or one of your friends had to leave early you can stick the picture of the work in progress on your facebook group so you can keep track of what you have done and the progress. 
  Then you can go back to it and work on it together until you have finished it to a point where you want to share it with the world! and post it on your facebook with lots of smileys faces saying something like "look what I did!"
</p>
<p>I found Fais' stage and commit analogy</p><a href="https://fai-songprasit.github.io/blog/sprint1-reflections.html">Here via Google.</a>

<h4> Branch, Pull, Merge</h4>

<h4>What is main?</h4>

<p>Main or orgin, is the default name new repositories get when created in GitHub and then when new branches are created by users, they can customise the name.</p>
<h4>Why create a Branch?</h4>
<p>
GitHub exists to allow for version control and collaboration of multiple team members or users on a single project. The branches are different versions of the origion or main version. Creating the branches to work separately on the same project allows for the project lead to ensure security of the project, to prevent possible headaches. As sometimes new updates or features will actually need to be rolled back. Which is alot easier when you just need to reload a previous commit or saved point in the project.

<h4>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</h4>
<p>
It feels intuitive for me. Only because I'm farmiliar with them.</p>
<h4>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h4>
<p>A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Some examples of where you might fork include when you would like to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>

<p>Some examples include when you want to create your own version of the repo by forking it to your account. Such as the reflections repo, so you can create your own version. Or, the Dev Academy Ko Wai Koe repo, so you can introduce yourself in Maori to the main. It could be any project you want to work on without impacting the main project.</p>
<h4>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h4>
<p>Previously, yes. This time not really, as I'm already farmiliar with commandline, Git and GitHub. Although I'm no expert. It would of been nice to be challenged a little more. But I'll be doing this with Sprint 2 onwards content and challenges.</p>
<h4>Setup Repo & Create Blog
</h4> <h4>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
</h4>
<p>Creating a repo for the Blog challenge was realtivity easy.</p>

<p>https://github.com/gracemorganmaxwell/gracemorganmaxwell.github.io</p>
<h4>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
</h4>
<p>I guess this being my second time here in Foundations meant I already knew what to expect somewhat, although I did wonder if there would be changes.</p>
<h4>Thinking like a programmer</h4>
<h4>What is your process so far for solving problems?
</h4>
<p>After going through the resources in Sprint 1, I feel more confident attacking the challenges ahead of me. Ultimiately it boils down to:</p>

<p>Building habits - creating an environment for myself that gets me motivated to do the things I set out to do that day. Building activities in a chain sequence (micro habits) throughout the day to ensure I take care of myself, stay on task and bases are covered to avoid distractions or interruptions.</p>

<p>Undertsand - Understand exactly what is being asked before starting. And if I'm unsure, approach from a new angle, try seeing it with a fresh set of eyes and after X amount of time try asking for help.</p>

<p>Plan - create a framework for myself to follow. Like writting an essay there is an intro, body and conclusion. It is the same with any project. And nicely Foudations has a plan, with timeboxes built into it.
</p>
<p>Divide - Split the work into smaller problems to be solved one at a time, preferrable in chronological order but one you can get back to if you are stuck on it for too long. Sometimes it's best to do the easiest step first or eat the frog and do the hardest. All dependant of the project or task at hand though.
</p>
<p>Get Unstuck - get a second opinion, get a perspective, have a break, look at it again, try again. All of those thing until it works. If all else fails? Start again.
</p>
<p>Refractor - See if there is any way to improve your solution, make it more efficent, have less redundant lines, use less words to get to the point.
</p>
<p>Reflect - Think about what you have done so far, what you had a problem with and what you have learned from your experience and hope that you can improve the next time you do somthing similar.
</p>
<p>Practice - Everyone learns better by doing, all the time, repeat the same motion. It's like exercising. if you never go running you'll never be able to run 10km, start small, do it often and build up your fitness and tolerance.</p>
</p>
  <h4>Introduce yourself</h4>
  <h4>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</h4>
   <p>I posted the following:</p> <p>"Hey everyone! Gracie here, I'm based in Christchurch. Integrity, authenticity and balance are essential to me. It's so true what they say about 'first taking care of yourself, before trying to help others', to make sure you have a good life balance. 
     But also 'treat others, how you would like to be treated' and 'always trying to put your best foot forward' and naturally 'learn from your mistakes'. Could I have included any more cheesy cliches? I'm attending Dev Academy because I love to help others, I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving, and I love dabbling in tech. 
     Through gaining the right skills during Foundations + Bootcamp, I know I'll feel ready to hit the ground running, find an opportunity and join a team where I can make a difference."</p>     
    <p>It's hard to make an elevator speech for yourself, but it feels like a safe space and this time I choose to keep it more generalised, instead of sharing my lifes story.</p>
  <h4>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</h4>
  <p>Yes, I could definitely feel my ego kicking in. Thus far hasn't been a great start or a good representation of what I am capable of. I am still afraid of showing up as weak. But I am going to allow myself to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Because in reality I know this is a safe space where I am suppose to grow and be authentic.</p>
