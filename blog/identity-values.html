            Integrity, authenticity and balance are essential to me. It's so
            true what they say about 'first taking care of yourself, before
            trying to help others, to make sure you have good life balance. But
            also 'treat others, how you would like to be treated' and 'always
            trying to put your best foot forward' and naturally to 'learn from
            your mistakes'. Could I have included any more cheesy cliches? My
            apologies. They roll off the tongue so easily and communicate an
            idea effectively in such a nice concise phrase.
          </p>

            Growing up, I always found it hard to say 'no' to others, and I
            always wanted to keep everyone around me happy. I'm working on it,
            of course. But I have PTSD, and a part of that is I believe I've
            been a people pleaser most of my life, something to do with wanting
            to belong to a group, family, organisation or team. Whatever the
            flavour of the month is. These experiences compounded over the years
            have shaped me regarding my character and my conduct with others in
            all walks of life. So now I try to say 'can I sleep on that' or a
            straight-up 'no' if I have enough spinning plates I'm trying to
            balance at the time.

            I took that 16 personalities test by Myers Briggs and got the result
            of Protagonist. This result was quite relatable for me; I always see
            potential in others. Ideas sprout in my mind of how they could grow
            their potential further. I've always sported a growth mindset set
            for myself and others around me. I want the best for everyone, for
            them to be happy. In turn, I get joy from seeing others grow. Sounds
            cheesy, I know. But helping others, purely that is meaningful for
            me, its a purpose to get me out of bed in the morning and keep me
            accountable to my word. These days it's my daughter mostly, our pets
            (two dogs, two cats) and close friends and family, plus the odd bit
            of volunteering or contracting.

            Previously I worked for a telecommunications retail service provider
            offering internet and mobile services to the residential and small
            business markets. I did online admin and customer service, which was
            excellent until sales KPIs came into it. Through moving sideways to
            customer-centric roles, I escaped sales and went on to enjoy my job
            in a digital space for many years, gaining responsibilities in
            social media management. Alas, all good things come to an end,
            especially with upper management needing to make cutbacks. Something
            I didn't realise about mental health conditions like PTSD back then
            is sometimes we don't want to acknowledge something happened to us
            because then we need to face it and deal with it. I started my
            rehabilitation through ACC, working various roles on and off over
            the last couple of years while raising my daughter.

            I'm attending Dev Academy because I love to help others, I enjoy the
            challenge of problem-solving, and I love dabbling in tech. Through
            gaining the right skills during Foundations + Bootcamp, I know I'll
            feel ready to hit the ground running, find an opportunity and join a
            team where I can make a difference.
