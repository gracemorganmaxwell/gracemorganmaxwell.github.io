    <h2>Sprint 2</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      Integrity, authenticity and balance are essential to me. It's so true what
      they say about 'first taking care of yourself, before trying to help
      others, to make sure you have good life balance. But also 'treat others,
      how you would like to be treated' and 'always trying to put your best foot
      forward' and naturally to 'learn from your mistakes'. Could I have
      included any more cheesy cliches? My apologies. They roll off the tongue
      so easily and communicate an idea effectively in such a nice concise
      phrase.

      Growing up, I always found it hard to say 'no' to others, and I always
      wanted to keep everyone around me happy. I'm working on it, of course. But
      I have PTSD, and a part of that is I believe I've been a people pleaser
      most of my life, something to do with wanting to belong to a group,
      family, organisation or team. Whatever the flavour of the month is. These
      experiences compounded over the years have shaped me regarding my
      character and my conduct with others in all walks of life. So now I try to
      say 'can I sleep on that' or a straight-up 'no' if I have enough spinning
      plates I'm trying to balance at the time.

      I took that 16 personalities test by Myers Briggs and got the result of
      Protagonist. This result was quite relatable for me; I always see
      potential in others. Ideas sprout in my mind of how they could grow their
      potential further. I've always sported a growth mindset set for myself and
      others around me. I want the best for everyone, for them to be happy. In
      turn, I get joy from seeing others grow. Sounds cheesy, I know. But
      helping others, purely that is meaningful for me, its a purpose to get me
      out of bed in the morning and keep me accountable to my word. These days
      it's my daughter mostly, our pets (two dogs, two cats) and close friends
      and family, plus the odd bit of volunteering or contracting.

      Previously I worked for a telecommunications retail service provider
      offering internet and mobile services to the residential and small
      business markets. I did online admin and customer service, which was
      excellent until sales KPIs came into it. Through moving sideways to
      customer-centric roles, I escaped sales and went on to enjoy my job in a
      digital space for many years, gaining responsibilities in social media
      management. Alas, all good things come to an end, especially with upper
      management needing to make cutbacks. Something I didn't realise about
      mental health conditions like PTSD back then is sometimes we don't want to
      acknowledge something happened to us because then we need to face it and
      deal with it. I started my rehabilitation through ACC, working various
      roles on and off over the last couple of years while raising my daughter.

      I'm attending Dev Academy because I love to help others, I enjoy the
      challenge of problem-solving, and I love dabbling in tech. Through gaining
      the right skills during Foundations + Bootcamp, I know I'll feel ready to
      hit the ground running, find an opportunity and join a team where I can
      make a difference.
